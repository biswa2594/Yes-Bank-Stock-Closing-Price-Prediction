# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

This Capstone Project aims to predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank's stock using historical stock market data. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the stock price.

The first step in the project is data preprocessing, where the historical stock market data is collected and cleaned. The dataset contains the stock price for each month along with various financial indicators like the opening price, closing price etc.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets, and various machine learning models are trained on the training set. The models used in this project include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regression.

Once the models are trained, they are evaluated on the testing set using various evaluation metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (R2) score. The model with the lowest RMSE and MAE and the highest R2 score is selected as the final model.

Finally, the selected model is used to predict the monthly closing price for the next months, and the results are visualized using various charts and graphs.
